## 🕸️ Marvel CTF Challenge

Welcome to the **Marvel CTF** – a cybersecurity challenge series I created for **Mindkraft '25**, the national-level technical symposium hosted by **Karunya University**. This event is designed to test participants’ practical hacking and problem-solving skills through fun, story-driven Capture The Flag (CTF) puzzles inspired by the **Marvel Universe**.

Each challenge blends real-world cybersecurity concepts with iconic Marvel characters, locations, and lore – turning digital forensics, cryptography, steganography, and more into immersive mini-missions.
